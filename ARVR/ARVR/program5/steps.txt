Steps to Run Your Prog5 Script in Unity
Your script rotates a GameObject and shoots a 2D Raycast in the right direction. Follow these steps to test it in Unity:

Step 1: Open Unity & Create a 2D Project
Open Unity Hub and click New Project.
Select 2D Core as the template and click Create Project.
Step 2: Create a GameObject & Attach the Script
Create an Empty GameObject

In the Hierarchy window, click + (Create) → Create Empty
Rename it to RotatingObject
Attach the Script to the GameObject

Select RotatingObject
In the Inspector, click Add Component
Search for Prog5 and click it to attach the script
Step 3: Create a Visual Target for Raycast
To see raycasting in action, add an object for the ray to hit.

Create a 2D Sprite (Obstacle)
In the Hierarchy, click + (Create) → 2D Object → Sprite
Rename it to Obstacle
Position it to the right of RotatingObject (so the ray hits it)
Add a Collider:
In the Inspector, click Add Component
Search for BoxCollider2D and add it
Step 4: Adjust the Script’s Settings
Click on RotatingObject.
In the Inspector, under Prog5:
Set Speed = 20 (controls rotation speed)
Set Distance = 10 (how far the ray shoots)
Step 5: Run the Scene
Click Play at the top of the Unity Editor.
Look at the Console Window:
If the ray hits the obstacle, it logs:
makefile
Copy
Edit
Hit: Obstacle
If the ray does not hit anything, it logs:
yaml
Copy
Edit
No hit
Step 6: View Debug Rays
Stop the game.
Go to Scene View (not Game View).
Play the game again and look for red/green lines:
Red Line = Ray hit an object
Green Line = Ray missed
